NPA is an app built by Samuel Wang for the startup Next Professional Athlete.
The app features a resource hub, shops for athletes, and social media feed populated with App clips. 
This app serves as a mock app demo for investors.

## Backend:
The App is built with UIKit, SwiftData (Database) for storing user chats, currently working on MongoDB Integration for posts. 
I use JSON data for storing YoutubeDataAPI Requests to populate the feed, keep track of which videos users have watched. 
User information is stored using MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel) architecture, keeping track of appstate in 
model objects to support seemless UI updates. 

## Frontend:
I used SwiftUI and UIKit to create the custom UIViews, Tabbars, for the app.
